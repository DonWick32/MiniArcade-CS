# Mini Arcade - A Computer Science Project

A school project in Computer Science that was submitted by a team of 3 - Karthick Krishna M, Nitish Nagarajan, Revanth Krishna S<br>
We made 5 different games in python turtle and used a code to combine them all into one final arcade (final.py). The individual codes and files are present in the directory __ProjectFiles__ as shown, but might differ when used in context of the combined final code. Pong is the only <i> multi-player </i> game out of the lot.

## How to Play:

### Gameplay:
*Hangman* uses the **alphabet and number keys** of the keyboard. <br>
Targets have to be **left-clicked** on in *Target Practice*. <br>
*Pong* is a multi-player game with the **Player-1 using the 'W' and 'S' keys** to control and **Player-2 using 'Up' and 'Down' Arrow keys** to control.<br>
*Snake* and *Obstacle Collision* use the **'WASD' keys** for movement. <br>
<br><strong>
