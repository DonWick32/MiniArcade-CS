# Mini Arcade - A Computer Science Project

A school project in Computer Science that was submitted by a team of 3 - Karthick Krishna M, Nitish Nagarajan, Revanth Krishna S<br>
We made 5 different games in python turtle and used a code to combine them all into one final arcade (final.py). The individual codes and files are present in the directory __ProjectFiles__ as shown, but might differ when used in context of the combined final code. Pong is the only <i> multi-player </i> game out of the lot.

## How to Play:

### Gameplay:
*Hangman* uses the **alphabet and number keys** of the keyboard, **spacebar** for hints <br>
Targets have to be **left-clicked** on in *Target Practice*. <br>
*Pong* is a multi-player game with the **Player-1 using the 'W' and 'S' keys** to control and **Player-2 using 'Up' and 'Down' Arrow keys** to control.<br>
*Snake* and *Obstacle Collision* use the **'WASD' keys** for movement. <br>
<br><strong>
If a game is over, press '**Enter**' to replay the game and press '**Esc**' to exit to the Main-Menu<br>
<br></strong>
### Objectives, Scoring and When the Game Ends:

##### *Hangman*: 
You guess the right letters for the blanked word on the screen, given three clues that appear when you hit the spacebar. You keep typing letters until you get the whole word right before getting hanged. The game ends when you get hanged, i.e. 9 tries.<br><br>

##### *Target Practice*: 
Click on the targets that appear randomly on your screen within the given time of 30 seconds. Clicking the center of the target gives you 10 points and the edge gives you 2 points. Anywhere in between fetches you 5 points. The game ends when the specified 30 seconds run out.<br><br>

##### *Pong*: 
Use the keys mentioned above to play with another player next to you. The paddles are always movable and the pong ball bounces off them when in contact. The opponent gains one point when the pong ball hits a player's own side wall. The game ends when either of the players get 3 points. <br><br>

##### *Snake*: 
Use the above-mentioned keys and grow as long as possible by eating food that appears randomly on the screen one-by-one. You get 10 points for each food particle eaten. There are 3 tries before the game ends. Each try ends when the snake collides with any of the walls, or itself.<br><br>

##### *Obstacle Collision*: 
Use the keys mentioned above to navigate from the left end of the screen to the right. Colliding with an obstacle in the way ends your game. There are no points or penalities.<br><br>
